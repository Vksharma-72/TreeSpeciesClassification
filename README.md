## üå≥ Tree Species Identification Project

This project bridges the gap between traditional botanical expertise and modern artificial intelligence by developing a robust **Tree Species Identification System** using machine learning. The objective is to enable fast, scalable, and accurate identification of tree species based on image data, which can significantly enhance ecological research, forest conservation, and biodiversity monitoring efforts.

### üîç Project Overview

Tree identification has traditionally relied on manual methods, requiring expertise in botany and fieldwork. This project uses image classification techniques powered by **AI/ML** to automate the process. Leveraging a labeled dataset of tree images, we train deep learning models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks) to recognize and classify tree species based on visual characteristics such as leaf shape, bark texture, and canopy structure.

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Domains

* Artificial Intelligence
* Machine Learning
* Computer Vision
* Deep Learning (CNNs)
* Image Classification

### üéØ Key Goals

* Develop an image-based classifier to identify different tree species.
* Create a user-friendly pipeline for model training, testing, and evaluation.
* Explore dataset augmentation and pre-processing to improve accuracy.
* Make the system scalable for mobile or web deployment for field use.

### üì¶ Dataset

The model uses a curated dataset of labeled images for training and validation. Preprocessing steps include resizing, normalization, and augmentation to handle varying lighting and angle conditions.

### üå± Applications

* Ecological monitoring
* Forest biodiversity research
* Environmental education tools
* Mobile apps for nature enthusiasts and researchers
